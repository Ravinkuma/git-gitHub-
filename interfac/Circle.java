/*An interface in java is a bluePrint of a class.
 Method and class declaration in interface is the same as abstraction.
 Interface implemented in class thatâ€™s why it is called as bluePrint of class.
 
 In Java, an interface is a reference type that defines a set of abstract methods. It's a way to 
 achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance.
